# Creating a new Laravel Project

Open terminal and type:

``` bash
cd C:\laragon\www\
```

Make sure that we are on the <code>C:\\laragon\\www\\</code> folder before creating any laravel project. Once done, we can now create our project:

``` bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel project-name
```

This command creates a new laravel project with default configuration using composer. The installation might take a while depending on the number of packages being installed.


Once done, you can now go inside the project folder:

``` bash
cd project-name
```
